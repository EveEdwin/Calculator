# Calculator
Provided Python code uses the Tkinter library to build a basic calculator with a graphical user interface


Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Imports:** 
   - `import tkinter as tk`: Imports the Tkinter library and aliases it as `tk`.

2. **Functions:**
   - `button_click(number)`: Updates the entry field when a number or operator button is clicked.
   - `calculate()`: Evaluates the expression entered in the entry field and displays the result.
   - `clear()`: Clears the entry field.

3. **Main Window Setup:**
   - Creates the main window using `tk.Tk()` and sets its title as "Calculator".
   - Creates an entry field (`entry`) where the input and output are displayed. It's placed at the top of the window.

4. **Button Creation and Placement:**
   - Defines the buttons for numbers (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), clear (C), and equals (=).
   - Uses a nested loop to create and position the buttons in a grid layout within the window.
   - Each button is associated with a command:
     - Numbers and operators buttons call `button_click()` to update the entry field with the respective number/operator.
     - '=' button calls `calculate()` to compute the expression and display the result.
     - 'C' button calls `clear()` to clear the entry field.

5. **Main Loop:**
   - Initiates the main event loop (`root.mainloop()`) to run the Tkinter application, allowing user interaction.

The code constructs a basic calculator with a clear interface using Tkinter, enabling users to perform arithmetic calculations by clicking buttons on the graphical interface. It handles input, performs calculations, and displays results/error messages accordingly in the entry field.
